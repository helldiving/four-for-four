Websocket chat application to practice Springboot and Java as I enjoy Java a lot, but have spent a lot of time with JavaScript with Homediggities stuff.

Not sure if I'll implement a Java or JS version of a chat feature in Homedigplatv2.

I want to say Java for practice, but JS for _good_ practice.
