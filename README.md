Goal: a chat application using Spring Boot and React that connects four random users globally for time-limited, rule-based interactions, featuring voting mechanisms aimed at fostering unique and engaging social experiences.

Websocket chat application to practice Springboot and Java as I enjoy Java a lot, but have spent a lot of time with JavaScript with Circle Up stuff.

Not sure if I'll implement a Java or JS version of a chat feature in Circle Up.

Reminder: check Obsidian folder for documentation.
